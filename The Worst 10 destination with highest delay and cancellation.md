## The Worst 10 destination with highest delay and cancellation

To identify the worst 10 destinations with the highest average delays and cancellations, I will calculate the average delay and 
cancellation rate for each destination airport. Then, I will rank these airports based on these metrics to find the top 10 worst 
performers.

Here are the worst 10 destination airports with the highest average delays and cancellation rates in 2009:

### Observations:
- EWR (Newark Liberty International Airport) and LGA (LaGuardia Airport), both in the New York area, are among the top destinations with significant delays and high cancellation rates.
- Other airports like CIC (Chico Municipal Airport) and MOD (Modesto City-County Airport) also show high delays and cancellations, indicating operational challenges.
- Smaller airports such as LWB (Greenbrier Valley Airport) and EYW (Key West International Airport), despite lower traffic, still face substantial delay issues.
