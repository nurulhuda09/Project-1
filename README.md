# Airline Delay and Cancellation Analysis

The dataset contains various flight-related details such as date, carrier information, origin, destination, scheduled and actual departure times, delays and cancellation in 2009. The goals of this analysis is to explore the common cause for flight delays, cancellation trends, temporal pattern for flight delays, yearly performance metric and worst destinations for flight delay and cancellation

### Here is the graph showing the comparison between actual and cancelled flights per month in 2009:

### Observations:

- The graph highlights the months with higher cancellation rates, particularly January and December, which aligns with the earlier analysis.
- The number of actual flights remains relatively consistent across most months, with a notable peak in September.
- This visualization provides a clear view of how cancellations fluctuated throughout the year in relation to the total flights operated.

### Here is the graph showing the comparison between average actual flight time and average delay time per month in 2009:

### Observations:

- The average actual flight time remains relatively consistent across the months, indicating stable flight durations.
- The average delay time varies more significantly, with peaks in the summer months and around the holiday season in December.
