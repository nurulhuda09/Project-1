# What are the most common causes of flight delays in this dataset?

To determine the most common causes of flight delays, I'll analyze the columns related to delay reasons in the dataset. These typically include:

-CARRIER_DELAY
-WEATHER_DELAY
-NAS_DELAY
-SECURITY_DELAY
-LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY

## Summary:
-Carrier Delay: Total of 18,103,160 minutes with an average delay of approximately 15.47 minutes per affected flight. 
-Weather Delay: Total of 3,225,415 minutes with an average delay of approximately 2.76 minutes per affected flight. 
-NAS Delay (National Aviation System): Total of 19,246,976 minutes with an average delay of approximately 16.44 minutes per affected flight. 
-Security Delay: Total of 75,009 minutes with an average delay of approximately 0.06 minutes per affected flight. 
-Late Aircraft Delay: Total of 22,868,720 minutes with an average delay of approximately 19.54 minutes per affected flight.

From this analysis, the most common causes of delays by total minutes are Late Aircraft Delay, NAS Delay, and Carrier Delay. These three factors contribute significantly to the overall delay times in the dataset.
