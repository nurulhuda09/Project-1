#Cancellation Trend

To analyze the cancellation trend, I will calculate the total number of flights and the number of cancelled flights per month throughout the year 2009. 
This will help us understand how cancellations varied month by month.

## Observations:

- January and December show the highest numbers of cancellations, which could be attributed to adverse weather conditions typically experienced during these months.
- May has the lowest number of cancellations.
- The data for October appears to be missing, which might need further investigation or could be due to data collection issues.

This trend suggests that seasonal factors, possibly including weather and holiday travel, significantly influence flight cancellations.
